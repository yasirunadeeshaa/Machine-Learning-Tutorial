## ✅ Difference Between Algorithm and Model

### 🔁 Algorithm
- **Definition**: A set of rules or procedures used to solve a problem or perform a task.
- **Purpose**: Guides how learning happens from the data.
- **Examples in ML**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K-Means, Gradient Descent.
- **Analogy**: The recipe.

### 📦 Model
- **Definition**: The output/result of an algorithm after training on data.
- **Purpose**: Used to make predictions.
- **Examples in ML**: A trained linear regression model that predicts house prices.
- **Analogy**: The final dish prepared using the recipe (algorithm) and ingredients (data).

| Feature         | Algorithm                | Model                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| What is it?     | Step-by-step method      | Trained result                 |
| Used for?       | Learning from data       | Making predictions             |
| In ML context   | Learning strategy (SVM)  | Learned function (f(x))        |
| Example         | Decision Tree algorithm  | Tree built from training data  |
| Analogy         | Cooking recipe           | Final meal                     |

## 🧠 Types of Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
You’re given **labeled data** and the algorithm learns to map input to output.

#### 📊 Regression
- **Output**: Continuous (numeric) values  
- **Examples**:
  - Predicting house prices
  - Predicting temperature
  - Estimating salary

#### 📂 Classification
- **Output**: Categories (labels)  
- **Examples**:
  - Spam or not spam
  - Sick or healthy
  - Cat or dog classification

---

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
No labels are given — the model finds patterns and structures on its own.

#### 📌 Clustering
- Groups similar data points together.
- **Examples**:
  - Customer segmentation
  - Grouping news articles by topic

#### 📉 Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduces number of features.
- **Examples**:
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  - Image feature extraction

---

### 3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
Uses a mix of a small amount of labeled data + a large amount of unlabeled data.

---

### 4. **Reinforcement Learning**
An agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Examples**: Self-driving cars, Game-playing AI, Robotics.

---

### 5. **Self-Supervised Learning**
The model generates its own labels from input data.
- Used heavily in **LLMs** like ChatGPT, BERT, etc.

## 📐 Linear Regression — Simplified

- **Goal**: Predict continuous values using known data.
- **Equation**: `Y = mX + b`  
  - `m`: slope  
  - `b`: intercept  
- **Process**:
  1. Collect data
  2. Train model to fit best line
  3. Predict new values

## 📌 Logistic Regression — Simplified

- **Goal**: Predict probability of binary classification.
- **Uses**: Pass/Fail, Spam/Not Spam.
- **Key Step**: Apply **sigmoid function** to map values between 0 and 1.
- **Decision**:
  - If probability ≥ 0.5 → Class 1
  - Else → Class 0

## 📜 Key Terms
- **Feature (X)**: Input variable.
- **Label (Y)**: Output variable.
- **Loss/Error**: Difference between prediction and actual.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average prediction error.
